GNU /ɡnuː/ (About this sound listen)^[3]^[4] is an operating system and an
extensive collection of computer software.^[5]^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10] GNU is
composed wholly of free software,^[11]^[12]^[13] most of which is licensed
under the GNU Project's own General Public License (GPL).

GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix!",^[11]^[14] chosen because
GNU's design is Unix-like, but differs from Unix by being free software and
containing no Unix code.^[11]^[15]^[16] The GNU project includes an operating
system kernel, GNU HURD, which was the original focus of the Free Software
Foundation (FSF).^[11]^[17]^[18]^[19] However, non-GNU kernels, most famously
Linux, can also be used with GNU software; as the Hurd kernel is not yet
production-ready,^[20] this is how the GNU system is usually used.^[21]^[22]
The combination of GNU software and the Linux kernel is commonly known as Linux
(or less frequently GNU/Linux; see GNU/Linux naming controversy).

Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU project

Richard Stallman, the founder of the project, views GNU as a "technical means
to a social end".^[23] Relatedly Lawrence Lessig states in his introduction to
the second edition of Stallman's book Free Software, Free Society that in it
Stallman has written about "the social aspects of software and how Free
Software can create community and social justice."^[24]

History[edit]

Development of the GNU operating system was initiated by Richard Stallman while
he worked at MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. It was called the GNU
Project, and was publicly announced on September 27, 1983, on the
net.unix-wizards and net.usoft newsgroups by Stallman.^[25] Software
development began on January 5, 1984, when Stallman quit his job at the Lab so
that they could not claim ownership or interfere with distributing GNU
components as free software.^[26] Richard Stallman chose the name by using
various plays on words, including the song The Gnu.^[4]^(00:45:30)

The goal was to bring a wholly free software operating system into existence.
Stallman wanted computer users to be free to study the source code of the
software they use, share software with other people, modify the behavior of
software, and publish their own modified versions of the software. This
philosophy was later published as the GNU Manifesto in March 1985.^[27]

Richard Stallman's experience with the Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS),^
[26] an early operating system written in assembly language that became
obsolete due to discontinuation of PDP-10, the computer architecture for which
ITS was written, led to a decision that a portable system was necessary.^[4]^(
00:40:52)^[28] It was thus decided that the development would be started using
C and Lisp as system programming languages,^[29] and that GNU would be
compatible with Unix.^[30] At the time, Unix was already a popular proprietary
operating system. The design of Unix was modular, so it could be reimplemented
piece by piece.^[28]

Much of the needed software had to be written from scratch, but existing
compatible third-party free software components were also used such as the TeX
typesetting system, the X Window System, and the Mach microkernel that forms
the basis of the GNU Mach core of GNU Hurd (the official kernel of GNU).^[31]
With the exception of the aforementioned third-party components, most of GNU
has been written by volunteers; some in their spare time, some paid by
companies,^[32] educational institutions, and other non-profit organizations.
In October 1985, Stallman set up the Free Software Foundation (FSF). In the
late 1980s and 1990s, the FSF hired software developers to write the software
needed for GNU.^[33]^[34]

As GNU gained prominence, interested businesses began contributing to
development or selling GNU software and technical support. The most prominent
and successful of these was Cygnus Solutions,^[32] now part of Red Hat.^[35]

Components[edit]

Main article: List of GNU packages

The system's basic components include the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), the
GNU C library (glibc), and GNU Core Utilities (coreutils),^[11] but also the
GNU Debugger (GDB), GNU Binary Utilities (binutils),^[36] the GNU Bash shell^
[31]^[37] and the GNOME desktop environment.^[38] GNU developers have
contributed to Linux ports of GNU applications and utilities, which are now
also widely used on other operating systems such as BSD variants, Solaris and
macOS.^[39]^[better source needed]

Many GNU programs have been ported to other operating systems, including
proprietary platforms such as Microsoft Windows^[40] and macOS.^[41] GNU
programs have been shown to be more reliable than their proprietary Unix
counterparts.^[42]^[43]

As of November 2015, there are a total of 466 GNU packages (including
decommissioned, 383 excluding) hosted on the official GNU development site.^
[44]

GNU variants[edit]

Main article: GNU variants
[220px-GNewSense_screenshot]
 
gNewSense, an example of an FSF approved distribution
[220px-Parabola12]
 
Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, an example of an FSF approved distribution that uses
a rolling release model

The official kernel of GNU Project was the GNU Hurd microkernel; however, as of
2012, the Linux kernel became officially part of the GNU Project in the form of
Linux-libre, a variant of Linux with all proprietary components removed.^[45]

With the April 30, 2015 release of the Debian GNU/HURD 2015 distro,^[46]^[47]
GNU OS now provides the components to assemble an operating system that users
can install and use on a computer.^[48]^[49]^[50] This includes the GNU Hurd
kernel, that is currently in a pre-production state. The Hurd status page
states that "it may not be ready for production use, as there are still some
bugs and missing features. However, it should be a good base for further
development and non-critical application usage."^[48]

Due to Hurd not being ready for production use, in practice these operating
systems are Linux distributions. They contain the Linux kernel, GNU components
and software from many other free software projects. Looking at all program
code contained in the Ubuntu Linux distribution in 2011, GNU encompassed 8%
(13% including GNOME) and the Linux kernel 6% (increased to 9% when including
its direct dependencies).^[51]

Other kernels like the FreeBSD kernel also work together with GNU software to
form a working operating system.^[52] The FSF maintains that an operating
system built using the Linux kernel and GNU tools and utilities, should be
considered a variant of GNU, and promotes the term GNU/Linux for such systems
(leading to the GNU/Linux naming controversy).^[53]^[54]^[55] The GNU Project
has endorsed Linux distributions, such as gNewSense, Trisquel and Parabola GNU/
Linux-libre.^[56] Other GNU variants which do not use the Hurd as a kernel
include Debian GNU/kFreeBSD and Debian GNU/NetBSD, bringing to fruition the
early plan of GNU on a BSD kernel.

Copyright, GNU licenses, and stewardship[edit]

The GNU Project recommends that contributors assign the copyright for GNU
packages to the Free Software Foundation,^[57]^[58] though the Free Software
Foundation considers it acceptable to release small changes to an existing
project to the public domain.^[59] However, this is not required; package
maintainers may retain copyright to the GNU packages they maintain, though
since only the copyright holder may enforce the license used (such as the GNU
GPL), the copyright holder in this case enforces it rather than the Free
Software Foundation.^[60]

For the development of needed software, Stallman wrote a license called the GNU
General Public License (first called Emacs General Public License), with the
goal to guarantee users freedom to share and change free software.^[61]
Stallman wrote this license after his experience with James Gosling and a
program called UniPress, over a controversy around software code use in the GNU
Emacs program.^[62]^[63] For most of the 80s, each GNU package had its own
license: the Emacs General Public License, the GCC General Public License, etc.
In 1989, FSF published a single license they could use for all their software,
and which could be used by non-GNU projects: the GNU General Public License
(GPL).^[62]^[64]

This license is now used by most of GNU software, as well as a large number of
free software programs that are not part of the GNU Project; it is also the
most commonly used free software license.^[65] It gives all recipients of a
program the right to run, copy, modify and distribute it, while forbidding them
from imposing further restrictions on any copies they distribute. This idea is
often referred to as copyleft.^[66]

In 1991, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), then known as the
Library General Public License, was written for the GNU C Library to allow it
to be linked with proprietary software.^[67] 1991 also saw the release of
version 2 of the GNU GPL. The GNU Free Documentation License (FDL), for
documentation, followed in 2000.^[68] The GPL and LGPL were revised to version
3 in 2007, adding clauses to protect users against hardware restrictions that
prevent user to run modified software on their own devices.^[69]

Besides GNU's own packages, the GNU Project's licenses are used by many
unrelated projects, such as the Linux kernel, often used with GNU software. A
minority of the software used by most of Linux distributions, such as the X
Window System, is licensed under permissive free software licenses.

Logo[edit]

[110px-Gnu-30-b]
 
GNU 30th anniversary logo

The logo for GNU is a gnu head. Originally drawn by Etienne Suvasa, a bolder
and simpler version designed by Aurelio Heckert is now preferred.^[70]^[71] It
appears in GNU software and in printed and electronic documentation for the GNU
Project, and is also used in Free Software Foundation materials.

The image shown here is a modified version of the official logo. It was created
by the Free Software Foundation in September 2013 to commemorate the 30th
anniversary of the GNU Project.^[72]
